IAAS	Infrastructure as a service		Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.
PAAS	Platform as a service		This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.
SAAS	Software as a service		Software as a Service provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email where you can send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.
AZ	Availability Zone		When you launch an instance, you can select an Availability Zone or let us choose one for you. If you distribute your instances across multiple Availability Zones and one instance fails, you can design your application so that an instance in another Availability Zone can handle requests.
EBS	Elastic Block Storage		EBS in only intended for EC2 instances.

General storage types
•	Instance store/Ephemeral storage(Temporary storage)
•	S3 (Object based storage)
•	EBS (Elastic Block Storage)

•	Provisioned IOPS (SSD) – io1
•	Throughput Optimized (HDD) – st1
•	Cold (HDD) – sc1

EBS Characteristics
•	Billed on storage capacity and I/O
•	Does not need to be attached to an instance
•	Can be transferred across Availability zones
•	EBS volumes are designed for an AFR (annual failure rate) between 0.1 – 0.2 %
•	EBS volume data is replicated across multiple servers in an Availability zone.
•	SLA –  99.95 %

EBS Volumes types
•	c – Compute optimized
•	r – memory optimized
•	g – graphics optimized
•	i – storage optimized
RAID	Redundant Array of independent discs		This is used to increase IOPS performance

Example :- Multiple striped gp2 or standard volumes (typically RAID 0)
IOPS	Input Output Processing per second		
PIOPS	Provisioned IOPS		This is a kind of EBS volume, which is optimized for heavy I/P and O/P operations.
EFS	Elastic File System		Network attached storage
EC2	Elastic Compute Cloud		Virtual machine instances

EC2 instances types
•	On demand
o	Default
o	Most expensive option
o	No commitment
o	Prices vary by AWS region
o	Billed on an hourly basis
•	Reserved instances
o	Less expensive
o	Requires a commitment (1 or 3 years)
o	Reserved capacity hence lower hourly rate
o	You commit to utilization
o	Unwanted reserved instances can be sold at AWS market place
•	Spot instances
o	Unused AWS capacity from amazon
o	Very cheap hourly rate
o	Based on a bid hence Not guaranteed
o	Ideal for raw processing power, grid like application
o	Highly scriptable
S3	Simple Storage service		
S3 characteristics
•	It is not a file system, it is region-level storage system.
•	Supports Rest and Soap API
•	Needs globally unique S3 bucket name
o	Can be made Publicly accessible for static website hosting
•	Cross region replication
o	data is spread out in multiple facilities, you can lose two facilities and still have access to files
•	Data lifecycle management
o	Can be used to send data to glacier
•	Other features:- 
o	Versioning, Audit logs, event notification, permissions, MFA delete, time limited access
Other points
•	Secure, durable, highly scalable object store (1 byte to 5TB), universal namespace (must be unique bucket - regardless of regions),object based key value store, VersionID, Metadata, ACL
•	The total volume of data and number of objects you can store are unlimited. Individual Amazon S3 objects can range in size from 1 byte to 5 terabytes. The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 gigabytes. For objects larger than 100 megabytes, customers should consider using the Multipart Upload capability. it mean the largest single file into S3 is 5G, but after the 5G files are in S3, they can be assembled into a 5T file,
•	You can use a Multipart Upload for objects from 5 MB to 5 TB in size (Exam question, scenario where more than 5GB file needs to be uploaded)
•	object based storage vs block based Storage (EFS)
•	For PUTS of New Objects (Read after Write Consistency), For Overwrite PUTS and DELETE (Eventual Consistency)
•	http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/awsservicelimits.html#limits_s3 ( Number of S3 bucket limit per account — 100)
•	S3 transfer acceleration – objects are first uploaded to the nearest edge locations, and then copied over to the S3 bucket from the edge location.

RRS	Reduced redundancy storage		Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) is an Amazon S3 storage option that enables customers to store noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3’s standard storage.

RRS is designed to provide 99.99% durability per object over a given year. While RRS is less durable than standard Amazon S3, it is still designed to provide 400 times more durability than a typical disk drive

ACL	Access Control Lists		Amazon S3 Access Control Lists (ACLs) enable you to manage access to buckets and objects. Each bucket and object has an ACL attached to it as a sub resource. It defines which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access. When a request is received against a resource, Amazon S3 checks the corresponding ACL to verify the requester has the necessary access permissions.

CDN	Content Delivery Network		•	This is also known as CloudFront, this is basically used to keep the frequently accessed data in the edge locations.
•	Content Delivery Network - edge locations, reduced latency, and traffic serves from the closest nodes.
•	Edge locations - content will be cached (over 66 edge locations), different from region / AZ. TTL (speed of image // media is quicker - first user suffers the performance), can be not only read only (you can write it)
ELB	Elastic Load Balancer		ELB Characteristics
•	Region wide load balancer hence provides cross zone load balancing
•	Can be used internally or externally
•	Pre-Warming of ELB
o	In certain scenarios, such as when flash traffic is expected, or in the case where a load test cannot be configured to gradually increase traffic, we recommend that you “contact us” to have your load balancer "pre-warmed". 
o	We will then configure the load balancer to have the appropriate level of capacity based on the traffic that you expect. 
o	We will need to know below details.
	Start and end dates of your tests or expected flash traffic.
	The expected request rate per second
	Total size of the typical request/response that you will be testing.
•	SSL termination and processing
o	ELB takes care of validating SSL certificates on behalf of all the instances that are configured with it, hence saves time for the instances, as instances don’t have to validate the SSL certificates then, and saves time and resources on ec2 instances.
•	Cookie based sticky session
o	Types
	Duration based session stickiness
	Application controlled session stickiness
o	Same user will go to same server for all the subsequent requests
o	Note: - we should prefer to use database based sticky session instead of this.
•	Allows “Connection draining” on instances when it has to be taken out
o	Keeps existing connection to the instance for completion for a graceful exit, but does not allow new connections on the instance.
•	Integrates with 
o	Auto scaling

•	Message can contain up to 256KB of text, billed at 64KB chunks,
•	Single request can have 1 to 10 messages unto maximum of 256KB payload
•	Even though there is one message of 256Kb its basically 4 request for billing since (4 * 64KB)
•	NO ORDER - SQS messages can be delivered multiple times in any order
•	Design - you can have 2 priority queues for priority based message one for higher and other for lower priority
•	EC2 instances always poll for messages from the queue (pull from the queue and not push)
•	Visibility timeout always start from when the application instance polled the message.
•	Great design - Visibility timeout expires that means there is a failure somewhere since that message was polled but not processed and hence not deleted so other some other process will poll the message again and visibility timeout starts again.
•	Visibility timeout by default is 30 Seconds up to 12 hour maximum (ChangeMessageVisibility) / maximum visibility
•	Maximum long polling timeout 20 seconds (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html) —ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds
•	Messages in the Queue can be retained for up to 14 days
•	First 1 million requests are free, then $0.50 PER EVERY MILLION REQUESTS
SNS	Simple Notification Service		
•	Works on publish - subscribe model, SNS notifies the message, and hence push based approach. Inexpensive pay as you go

•	Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, EMAIL, EMAIL-JSON, SQS or Application - messages can be customized for each protocol
•	SNS messages are stored redundantly to multiple AZs
•	SNS Data format - JSON (Subject, Message, TopicArn, MessageId, unsubscribeURL etc..)
•	$0.50 per 1 million SNS request
•	Different price for different recipient types
•	to HTTP: $0.06 / 100,000 notifications deliveries
•	to EMAIL: $2 / 100,000 notifications deliveries
•	to SMS: $0.75 / 100 notifications deliveries
•	http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-send-devicetoken.html (CreatePlatformEndpoint API)
SWF	Simple Work Flow		
•	Simple Work flow - human interaction to complete order or collection of services to complete a work order.
•	Workers - interact with SWF to get task, process received task and return the result
•	Deciders - program that co-ordinates the tasks, i.e. - ordering, concurrency and scheduling
•	Workers and Deciders can run independently
•	TASK is only assigned ONCE and NEVER DUPLICATED (key difference from SQS where messages can be processed multiple times)
•	SWF Domain - think of it as a container for the work flow. you can register a domain by Console or API
•	Maximum workflow processing time can 1 year (equivalent seconds) - SQS is 12 hours processing time

DMZ	De-Militarized Zone		In computer networking, a De-Militarized Zone (DMZ) is a special local network configuration designed to improve security by segregating computers on each side of a firewall. A DMZ can be set up either on home or business networks, although their usefulness in homes is limited.
Bastion Host			This allows secure SSH access to EC2 instances in the private subnet. This is also called Jump Box. Bastion host exists in the public subnet only.
DR	Disaster Recovery		
RTO	Recovery Time Objective		This term is used in Disaster Recovery scenarios.
It is length of time, that is takes to recover from a disaster. It is measured from when the disaster first occurred till the time, when you have fully recovered from it.
RPO	Recovery Point Objective		It is the amount of the data that the organization is prepared to loose in the event of disaster. (Example: - 1 day worth of emails, 5 hours of online transaction records, 24 hours of backup etc...)

The lower the RTO and RPO threshold are, the costlier the DR solution will be.
Chef			Chef turns infrastructure into code, which makes infrastructure as versionable, testable, and repeatable as code. It stores recipes as well as configurations.
